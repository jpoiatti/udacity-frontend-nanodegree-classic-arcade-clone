# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

# Project Overview

This a clone recreation of a classic Frogger-like arcade game. The project structure, visual assets and game loop engine are provided in the starter repository (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

## How to play the game

Use the keyboard arrows (left, right, up, down) to move the character. 
The objective of the game is to cross the streets while avoiding colliding into the bugs and reach the water (blue tiles) located at the top.
If you collide with any bug the game will reset and the player will restart from the initial position (i.e. at the bottom), erasing the game level and the player's score.
